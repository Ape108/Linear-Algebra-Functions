## Linear Algebra From Scratch

This repository is a personal learning project where I'm implementing fundamental linear algebra concepts in Python from the ground up. The main goal is to solidify my understanding by translating the theory and mathematics into functional code without relying on external libraries like `NumPy` or `SciPy` for the core calculations.

Feel free to explore the code as I build out functions for:
* Vector and matrix arithmetic
* Determinants and inverses
* System of equation solvers
* Eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis
